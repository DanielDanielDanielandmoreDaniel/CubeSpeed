				<img src="Products/MGC4.png" alt="4 layered Rubik's cube">
				<p><b>MGC-4</b><br><br>This puzzle released by YJ in the middle of 2020, is by far the choice when it comes to buying a 4x4. With it being used by almost every top cuber these days, nothing even comes close to its near perfect performance.

				<img src="Products/MGC6.png" alt="6 layered Rubik's cube">
				<p><b>MGC-6</b><br><br>The MGC6 was a ground breaking puzzle in 6x6 hardware. With minimal popping and never before seen cornercutting, this puzzle was the clear choice for cubers until the release of the WRM.

With the MGC being such a large jump in performance from anything seen before cubers thought it would be a long time before it would be beaten, that was until the WRM. This cube is faster, smaller and has even better turning than the MGC for only $10 more.

				<p><b>WRM-7</b><br><br>This puzzle released by YJ is a revolutionaty cube. Similar with how the WRM6 took down the MGC6, the WRM7 is the clear choice over the MGC7. After using the WRM for a few days, every other 7x7 feels bulky and massive to hold with your fingers having to stretch just to make a single turn, the WRM's size alone makes it the best 7x7 out there.<br><br><b style="font-size: 1vw;">$70.00</b></p>

				<img src="Products/Mirror2.png" alt="Shape Shifting 2x2">
				<p><b>Mirror 2x2</b><br><br>This cube is a very confusing itteration of the 2x2 Rubik's Cube. The idea behind solving it is using shapes to solve it, rather than colours. This cube will change its shape with any moves, and with a few identical peices, and a cubic corner you can find yourself in many different parity positions that would never happen on a normal 2x2.<br><br><b style="font-size: 1vw;">$8.00</b></p>

It is the same idea as a normal 3x3, but you use shapes to solve it rathre than colours. This gives the cube the ability to change its shape with every turn. This can mess up your last layer recognition and make for a fun challenge for anyone tired of a normal 3x3.<br><br><b style="font-size: 1vw;">$13.00</b></p>

				<p><b>Gear Cube</b><br><br>This fun itteration of a normal 3x3 may seem scary at first, but as you start to turn the gears you may find that some 3x3 algorithms are applicable to this puzzle. With knowledge from both 2x2 and 3x3 (and maybe a bit of luck) any cuber will find this a puzzle a fun challenge and a cool looking addition to their collection.<br><br><b style="font-size: 1vw;">$25.00</b></p>

				<p><b>Gear Sandwich</b><br><br>This puzzle may seem easier than the standard gear cube, with only having 3 colours to deal with, but with the addition of single coloured edges and corners, you may find yourself in a position that can not be solved intuitivly like the normal gear cube.

				<p><b>2x2x3 Tower</b><br><br>This very fun puzzle may look simple, but may be quite a challenge for any cuber not too familiar with the square-1. With 180 degree turning similar to the slice of a square 1, you may need to look up some CP algs to help you out with the outer 2 layers, and some Roux algs for that pesky middle layer.<br><br><b style="font-size: 1vw;">$6.00</b></p>
